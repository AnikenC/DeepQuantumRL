# Deep Quantum Reinforcement Learning

This is a repository for applying Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning on Quantum Systems. Here we focus on the task of accelerating Transmon Qubit Readout by finding Optimal Pulse Waveforms for fast and high fidelity measurements.

This repository contains files for Readout Simulation and various Reinforcement Learning Algorithms including PPO, RPO, and TRPO, all written in Jax.
